## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Please read the following carefully before use:**

- **Risk Warning**: Using mods may involve unknown risks. If you insist on using them, remember this:**You accept all responsibility for any consequences, including account bans.**
- **Login Issues**: Repackaged APKs have signatures different from the official version, which may cause third-party authorization login to fail. Prioritize using QR code or verification code login.
- **Global Server Usage**: Before playing on global servers, be sure to check the [Global Server Usage Guide](Global.md); otherwise, you may be unable to enter the game.
- **Issue Reporting**: If you encounter problems such as permission request screens not popping up or floating windows not displaying, please submit an Issue.
