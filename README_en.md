# ♿ Azurlane JMBQ Build Releases

[简体中文](https://github.com/XiYueHura/Azurlane-Build/blob/main/README.md) | [ENGLISH](https://github.com/XiYueHura/Azurlane-Build/blob/main/README_en.md)

**🎉 JMBQ 2.8 builds for all clients have been updated! Please check the Releases section.**

> **⚠️ Warning:**
Using mods may involve unknown risks. If you insist on using them, remember this:
You accept all responsibility for any consequences, including account bans.

> **📝 Tips:** 
This repository only publishes mods by integrating JMBQ's released mods into the game. It is not the original mod release repository. If you encounter issues other than game loading failures, such as feature malfunctions, you should raise an Issue in JMBQ's mod repository instead of here.
